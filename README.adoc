# Integration Example of a Rasa Chatbot and a Qanary Question Answering System

The sole purpose of this repository is to provide a complete example of the integration of an integrated _generic chatbot UI_, a _Rasa chatbot_, and a _Qanary-driven question answering system_ (please recognize that the actual quality of the system is not in the focus).
The integration is done using a link:./Chatbot/actions[Rasa custom action] that passes the intended questions to the Qanary question answering system.
As a frontend, we use here a https://github.com/WDAqua/Qanary-Chatbot-UI[generic chatbot UI]. 
However, there are no specific requirements for the frontend.
Hence, you might use any other Rasa-compatible frontend (e.g., https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/connectors/your-own-website[a custom chatbot UI]) as well.

## Use Case 

The use case is the configured system is to compute the answer to a question about the birth date of a person. 
For example:

- Where and when was Albert Einstein born?
- Where was Albert Einstein born 
- when was Albert Einstein born?

The system is configured to answer the question using the following steps:

. Identify the firstname and lastname of the person using a NER, or NED, component
. Create a SPARQL query to query Wikidata for the birth date of the person
. Query Wikidata for the birth date of the person
. Prepare a HTML answer to the question to be displayed in the chatbot UI

## Starting the complete system using docker-compose

All components are orchestrated using a docker-compose file. 
The configuration is available at link:./docker-compose.yml[docker-compose.yml].
Use the following commands to build and start all components of this project.

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
----

The configuration parameters are available in the file link:./.env[.env].

WARNING: The first time you start the system, it takes a while to download all required docker images. Additionally, please be aware that starting the Rasa chatbot service takes a while (you might check the availability of components using the URLs shown below).

### Troubleshooting: no gpu support

GPU support is enabled by default in the file link:./docker-compose.yml[`docker-compose.yml`] as it is useful for speeding up the training process of the link:#_components_of_the_architecture[AutomationServiceComponent].
If you get the following error message, you need to upgrade your Docker version or remove the GPU support from the docker-compose file.

----
ERROR: for automation_component  device_requests param is not supported in API versions < 1.40
----

Please see https://github.com/WSE-research/Qanary-NER-automl-component/blob/main/README.adoc#possible-errors for specific troubleshooting details.

Additionally, we provide a docker-compose file without requested GPU support at link:./docker-compose-nogpu.yml[`docker-compose-nogpu.yml`].
To start the system without GPU support, use the following commands.

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose-nogpu.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose-nogpu.yml up
----


### Troubleshooting: new components' versions

The docker-compose file is configured to use the latest versions of the components.
The actual components' versions are shown in the console.
If you want to use a new (recently published) version of a component, you might need to force the docker-compose to pull the Docker images.

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose pull 
----


### Troubleshooting: Pipeline crashes due to Virtuoso errors
When first executing `docker-compose up` the Qanary pipeline may try to access the virtuoso instance before it is started. In this case, it helps to restart the pipeline. 

## Components of the architecture

The following components are integrated into this example.
Please recognize that the components are not part of this repository (links are provided for each component). 
In the following, the port numbers are shown for the default configuration of the docker-compose file.
